        <article class="article">
          <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;"> <br>
            Our Arab societies posses a great past, majestic glory, prestigious history, substantial victories, virtuous
            minds, sonventional paths <br> <br>
            A civilization whose essence is Islam , whose leader is the greatest of mankind, whose statement is to never
            look behind .. <br> <br>
            The origin of scientists .. the birth place of knowledge .. the destination of Muslims till the judgment
            day.. <br> <br>
            A civilization that arose, and subsequently .. the authentic history .. <br> <br> <br>

            The dawn of the Arab-Islamic civilization arose in the beginnings of the eighth century AD until the
            fifteenth century AD, and its distinction in religious, scientific, intellectual, and philosophical fields
            was between the middle of the ninth century AD and the twelfth century AD in what is known as the Islamic
            golden age, it was the origin of skillful scholars, eloquent writers, and shrewd pioneers. <br> <br>

            But civilizations are like a living organism in its cycle. As all civilizations begin with the stage of
            formation, then maturity and prosperity, then weakness and extinction. Often the reason behind this
            refraction is the internal weakness and disintegration, and the abundance of conflicts, oppositions, civil
            wars, class division, and so on. In these harsh ages, the great importance of countries supporting each
            other and rising to solve their pressing issues materialize to us. As they are united by one history,
            religion and language. <br> <br>

            Some Arab countries, such as Syria, Sudan, and Palestine, have faced great problems and difficulties, but
            they have found support from their Arab brothers, who always strive to uphold the word of the Arabs,
            preserve their unity, and overcome their complications. <br><br>

            Qatar is one of the strongest Arab countries internally and externally, which shows
            its permanent support for the brotherly Arab countries, and follows their footsteps in confronting the
            enemy, achieving peace, security and stability, and it has had - over the decades - wise opinions regarding
            the most prominent problems of the Arab world, which we will present below.. <br><br>

          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">1. Viewpoint on the Palestinian issue:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Qatar's position on the Palestinian issue is among the strongest and strongest in the
            Arab world. Historically, Qatar has played an important role in providing political, economic, and
            humanitarian assistance to all Palestinians for many years. These positions are based on shared values of
            moral humanity, upholding the resilience of the Palestinian people, upholding their legitimate rights, most
            importantly the establishment of their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital Qatar was one of the
            first Arab states to open an office of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which later became an
            embassy when the state of Palestine was declared at the Algiers Conference in 1988. Emir continues to
            emphasize Qatar's Viewpoint in support of the Palestinian cause and people, and strongly advocates an end to
            the Israeli occupation of the Arabs lands -continues to provide humanitarian assistance.<br><br>

            While many Arab governments have ignored the issue, Qatar has voiced its demands at international and UN
            forums, calling for an end to the occupation, a strong international stance against excesses do not cease
            settlement activity and prevent the occupation of Jerusalem. Compared to other Arab
            and Islamic states supporting this cause, Qatar's role is historically significant. Qatar played a key role
            in the signing of the Doha Accords between Palestinian factions on February 6, 2012, whether Fatah or Hamas,
            which agreed to form a unity government and presidential and parliamentary elections Procedures for national
            reconciliation will play a role in Qatar There have also been ongoing communication between the parties to
            develop.
            <br><br>

            Furthermore, Qatar consistently expresses its complete rejection of any measures that call for recognizing
            Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, as such actions undermine international efforts aimed at implementing
            the two-state solution. In the same context, Doha consistently emphasizes its rejection of plans to Judaize
            Jerusalem, alter its status, or relocate any embassy there. Qatar also opposes Israeli settlement activities
            in all forms and shapes. In addition to government aid during the period 2010-2016, Qatar provided nearly
            1.345 billion Qatari Riyals in non-governmental assistance.<br><br>

            These substantial funds were directed towards humanitarian and developmental sectors, healthcare, social
            welfare, employee salaries, and funding agencies engaged in humanitarian aid. Qatar also contributed 50
            million US dollars to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in June 2018
            to support the education sector, enabling UNRWA to open its schools without delay at the start of the
            academic year. <br> <br>

            Furthermore, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of the State of Qatar, ordered the
            immediate provision of assistance totaling 150 million US dollars to support Palestinians in Gaza and secure
            the necessary fuel for electricity generation. This Qatari grant comes after more than three years of
            waiting since Qatar announced the establishment of a fund for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, pledging
            a quarter of a billion dollars during the Arab Economic Summit held in Kuwait in January 2009, directly
            after the Zionist aggression on the Gaza Strip. <br><br>

          <h2 class="subheading">2. Viewpoint on the famine in Yemen:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph"> Qatar has played a significant role in alleviating the Yemeni famine. Qatar has
            supported peaceful solutions that ensure Yemen's security, stability and territorial integrity. It has for
            called the engagement of all stakeholders in the Yemeni scene with the support of the international
            community in a comprehensive political process and national reconciliation. These efforts aim to fulfill the
            aspirations of the Yemeni people for security, stability, and prosperity. Qatar welcomed the United Nations'
            announcement of a two-month extension of the ceasefire in Yemen, expressing hope that this extension will
            pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Yemeni crisis and the realization of the Yemeni people's
            aspirations for security peace, and development. <br><br>

            Additionally, Qatar has reported U.S. sanctions. $100 million for humanitarian activities in Yemen. A
            portion of this money will be donated to the World Food Program, underscoring the importance of funding to
            end hunger in Yemen and save millions of lives. In a statement, Mr. Beasley stressed Qatar's support, which
            includes the intervention of all stakeholders in the situation in Yemen supported by the international
            community, to a comprehensive political process and national reconciliation aims to fulfill the aspirations
            of the Yemeni people for security and stability and prosperity. Qatar welcomed the UN announcement to extend
            the ceasefire in Yemen for two months, expressing hope that the extension would pave the way for a peaceful
            solution to the Yemeni crisis and the security, peace, and development of the Yemeni people.<br><br>

            The World Food Program supports 12.9 million people in Yemen with emergency food assistance and provides
            specialized nutrition for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition to 3.3 million children and
            mothers.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">3. A violent was an end to an old friendship:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Qatar has been working on divisions in the Sudanese military and has called for an
            immediate ceasefire between rival factions in Sudan. Qatar has insisted on resolving disputes through
            dialogue. The call came in consideration of the conflict between the Sudanese Army and the "Rapid Support
            Force". Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed grave concern over the developing situation in
            Khartoum and Marawi, Sudan. Qatar called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities, exercise maximum
            restraint, engage in common sense, prioritize civilian interests and take civilians into account in the
            outcome of the conflict.<br>
            Qatar also expressed its hope that all parties would pursue dialogue and peaceful avenues to overcome their
            differences... <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">4. The view of Qatar on the problem of the grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam: </h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Egyptian President Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticizes Qatar's stance on the Grand Ethiopian
            Renaissance Dam (GERD). Mostafa Madbouli, who praised Qatar's role in supporting Egypt and Sudan on the GERD
            issue. Speaking to Qatar News Agency (QNA) on Tuesday, Madbouli, who is part of an official visit to Doha,
            said Qatar attached importance at different times to Egypt, Sudan and all Blue Basin countries finding a
            solution a "just, balanced and binding" one that serves the interests of all. Qatar also urged all parties
            to refrain from unilateral actions that could harm other Blue Basin countries. <br><br>

            Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar's Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced in mid-June 2021 a
            unified Arab stance regarding the GERD crisis in Ethiopia, calling on the parties involved to avoid
            unilateral measures and instead seek a comprehensive and fair resolution. <br><br>

            The Qatari Minister, speaking in joint press statements alongside Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the Secretary-General
            of the Arab League, after the meetings of Arab foreign ministers held in Doha, stressed that "all countries
            have affirmed the necessity of the engagement of all parties in good faith negotiations to urgently reach a
            fair, balanced, and binding agreement on the GERD that serves the common interests of Egypt, Sudan, and all
            Nile Basin countries." <br><br>

            Regarding the potential for Qatar to play a mediating role in the GERD issue, this possibility was not ruled
            out. The understanding is that Qatar possesses previous experience in regional and international mediation
            efforts. <br><br>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Sudanese Finance Minister Badr Al-Din Mahmoud said Qatar played an important economic role in Sudan. Qatar

            loss of foreign exchange Qatar provided investments that restored confidence in the economy, and actively
            supported ongoing economic growth pressures, and highlighted Qatar's support for peace, stability,
