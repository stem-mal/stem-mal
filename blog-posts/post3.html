                </section>
                <article class="article">
                    <p class="paragraph">For decades, Palestine has been plagued by relentless issues, resulting in the
                        loss of countless lives and political turmoil. There are numerous unaddressed problems facing
                        Palestine and the Palestinian people. These problems demand an urgent resolution that lasts.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">At the core of these overwhelming challenges facing Palestine is the ongoing
                        "Palestinian-Israeli conflict", an unceasing struggle that spanned countless generations. The
                        conflict dates back to the early 1900s, when Jews began immigrating to Palestine. After the end
                        of British rule in 1948, the State of Israel was established under the Jewish Zionist project,
                        resulting in the displacement of a huge number of Palestinians from their homes. There are
                        currently about 7.2 million Palestinian refugees scattered all around the world. The issue has
                        only grown since then, with the increase in violence because the political negotiations fail to
                        find lasting peaceful solution.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Palestinians currently residing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
                        are also burdened by severe economic difficulties. There are several hundred thousand Israeli
                        settlers of these territories, which are internationally considered illegal, has made it
                        difficult for Palestinians to regain their freedom or even access to work, education, and
                        medical care. The economy of Palestine is heavily dependent on international aid, mostly from
                        neighbouring Arab countries, and the many economic problem in the region has led to high levels
                        of poverty and unemployment, with the youth unemployment rate in Palestine at a staggering 58%,
                        shattering the aspirations of many young Palestinians.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Israeli security forces have been shown to use excessive force against
                        Palestinian protesters, and the Israeli government has been unrightfully imprisoning
                        Palestinians who speak up against the discrimination, as these Palestinians have been subjected
                        to curfews, checkpoints, and other measures to restrict their freedom, leaving them confined and
                        struggling for justice and equality.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">This is the issue as of today, despite numerous peace talks and negotiations, a
                        lasting solution to the Palestinian issue has yet to be found. Hopefully soon however, the
                        Palestinians will be freed from the shackles of colonialism, discrimination, and periodic wars.
                        For this to happen, it is agreed that something major must change.</p>
