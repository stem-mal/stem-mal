        <article class="article">
          <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;"> <br>
            Our Arab societies posses a great past, majestic glory, prestigious history, substantial victories, virtuous
            minds, sonventional paths <br> <br>
            A civilization whose essence is Islam , whose leader is the greatest of mankind, whose statement is to never
            look behind .. <br> <br>
            The origin of scientists .. the birth place of knowledge .. the destination of Muslims till the judgment
            day.. <br> <br>
            A civilization that arose, and subsequently .. the authentic history .. <br> <br> <br>

            The dawn of the Arab-Islamic civilization arose in the beginnings of the eighth century AD until the
            fifteenth century AD, and its distinction in religious, scientific, intellectual, and philosophical fields
            was between the middle of the ninth century AD and the twelfth century AD in what is known as the Islamic
            golden age, it was the origin of skillful scholars, eloquent writers, and shrewd pioneers. <br> <br>

            But civilizations are like a living organism in its cycle. As all civilizations begin with the stage of
            formation, then maturity and prosperity, then weakness and extinction. Often the reason behind this
            refraction is the internal weakness and disintegration, and the abundance of conflicts, oppositions, civil
            wars, class division, and so on. In these harsh ages, the great importance of countries supporting each
            other and rising to solve their pressing issues materialize to us. As they are united by one history,
            religion and language. <br> <br>

            Some Arab countries, such as Syria, Sudan, and Palestine, have faced great problems and difficulties, but
            they have found support from their Arab brothers, who always strive to uphold the word of the Arabs,
            preserve their unity, and overcome their complications. <br><br>

            UAE is one of the strongest Arab countries internally and externally, which shows
            its permanent support for the brotherly Arab countries, and follows their footsteps in confronting the
            enemy, achieving peace, security and stability, and it has had - over the decades - wise opinions regarding
            the most prominent problems of the Arab world, which we will present below.. <br><br>

          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">1. The UAE's Viewpoint on the Palestinian issue:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The UAE placed the Palestinian, in its founding as it established a central center, issue at its head for
            the Arab nation. The Emirati presence in the Palestinian cause remains; The Foreign Ministry said that more
            Israeli guarantees for the Palestinian lands would have destroyed any hopes for peace in the region. <br>
            <br>
            The United Arab Emirates has consistently upheld its support for the creation of a Palestinian state, shown
            sympathy with the national aspirations of the Palestinian people, and urged for a fair resolution to the
            Israeli-Palestinian issue based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative ever since it was founded. But the
            official ties established between the UAE and Israel within the framework of the Abraham Accords - in
            exchange for a halt to Israel's annexation intentions but without assurances for negotiations with the
            Palestinians and for the two-state solution - have led to speculation that the UAE abandoned its
            conventional stance on the matter. An analysis of the UAE's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
            the Palestinian issue as a result reveals a complicated web of goals, words, deeds, possibilities, and
            challenges. <br><br>
            The leadership of the Emirati nation has underlined that the Abraham Accords were the outcome of a
            diplomatic endeavor for the benefit of the Palestinian people in order to refute assertions made in the
            public that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had no real intention of executing annexation. The UAE claimed
            that Israel's decision to postpone the annexation was a condition for signing the accords for normalization
            and the outcome of pressure the UAE put on the Israeli government. <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">2. The view of the United Arab Emirates in the separation of Egypt from Syria:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">For the Syrian secession was a result of a military coup led by a clique of Syrian
            officers who were feeling neglected and oppressed by the central government in Cairo. <br>
            Separation sparked mixed reactions in some Arab countries as some countries like Saudi Arabia and Jordan
            supported it but some refused it like Iraq and Algeria. There is no clear evidence of the UAE's because it
            was under position on secession British protection until 1973 and was not yet an it can be assumed ,However,
            independent country that the UAE has been following developments in and is seeking to the region with
            interest strengthen its relations with both parties. <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">3. The view of the United Arab Emirates in the Yemen famine:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The UAE and Yemen have a complicated and tense relationship because the UAE played a significant role in
            regional politics in Yemen and has at various points been an enemy of the country. For example, the UAE's
            occupation of Socotra and support for the Southern Transitional Council, a secessionist group in Southern
            Yemen, have caused tension between the two countries and contributed to the ongoing conflict between the two
            countries. Additionally, the UAE has participated in other contentious Yemeni initiatives. The nation has
            been charged with supporting regional militias and separatist organizations that aspired to increase their
            autonomy or independence from the federal authority. <br><br>
            In order to help Yemen's Hadi government, the UAE joined the Saudi-led operation in Yemen. UAE seized
            administrative control of the island of Socotra from Yemen on April 30, 2018. A deal was negotiated between
            Yemeni forces and United Arab Emirates Armed Forces for a combined military training exercise and the
            handover of administrative authority of Socotra's airport and seaport to Yemen on May 14, two weeks after
            Saudi troops had also been sent to the archipelago. After the United Arab Emirates took control of Socotra,
            the relations remained tense for some time. <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">4. The point of view of the United Arab Emirates on the problem of Sudan (the current
            problem between Hamidti and Al-Burhan and the division of the Sudanese army):</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">The view of the UAE on the problem of Sudan is to support a political solution and
            dialogue between the 2 faces to preserve the stability, the conflicting parties and to provide humanitarian
            and unity of Sudan assistance to the Sudanese people. The UAE is closely following the developments and
            calls for calm and avoiding escalation. <br><br></p>
          <h2 class="subheading">5. The UAE's view of the Renaissance Dam problem:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The UAE's view of the Renaissance Dam problem is to support a political and diplomatic
            and support solving the problem with the continuous negotiation in a good faith avoiding any wars between
            the three countries (Sudan, Ethiopia, and Egypt) to preserve the rights and interests of them. UAE also
            affirms its support for the African Union and the commitment of the three countries.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subheading">
            6.	The view of the United Arab Emirates in the secession of South Sudan from Sudan: 
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The secession of South Sudan from Sudan was a result of a long civil war between the north and  the south of Sudan, led the South of Sudan to declare its independence as an independent state on 9/7/2011 and the UAE was among the first countries to show its support for peace and stability in the region. The UAE has provided humanitarian and has also help in the development of South Sudan sent peacekeeping forces to this country. <br><br>
            The UAE and Saudi Arabia used the 2018-2019 unrest in Sudan to ensnare Omar al-Bashir under their thumb after failing to successfully court him for years. They have achieved this by coopting members of the revolutionary coalition and supporting military and paramilitary figures under the pretense of "stability." In the crucial weeks that followed al-Bashir's overthrow, Emirati and Saudi support for the Transitional Military Council that succeeded him emboldened the generals, enabling the TMC to suppress protesters on June 3, 2019, stifling revolutionary demands for civilian rule, and facilitating the emergence of a power-sharing agreement in which the generals play a dominant role. <br><br>
